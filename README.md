## KuroganeHammer Smash 4 Frame Data Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that uses the [FrannHammer Api](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer) to provide a compact place to get to Smash 4 character frame data.  

Left-clicking a character tile in the extension will open up a new tab in Chrome for the selected Character's data page on KuroganeHammer.com.

Right-clicking a character tile in the extension will bring up a panel next to the chrome extension with the character's data in a more compact format.

The extension is built with Angular 2 (using Angular-CLI) and TypeScript.
