## KuroganeHammer Smash 4 Frame Data Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that uses the [FrannHammer Api](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer) to provide a compact place to get to Smash 4 character frame data.  


### Features 
Left-clicking a character tile in the extension will open up a new tab in Chrome for the selected Character's data page on KuroganeHammer.com.

Right-clicking a character tile in the extension will bring up a panel next to the chrome extension with the character's data in a more compact format.

### Tech stack
The extension is built with:
 - Angular 2 (using Angular-CLI) and TypeScript. 
 - Jasmine and Karma (testing)
 - VS Code
 - TravisCI (CI)
